## Organize a Folder by Extension
I create this script mostly because of my 'Downloads' folder. It's always messy, and I don't appreciate it. <br>

This script it's very simple: every time that you look to a folder with a lot of different files, you run the script in the terminal and that's it!<br>
<br>

### Simple instructions
* Open the Terminal in the folder that you want to organize;
* Make sure that the file 'organize.py' is in that folder
* Execute  **python3 organize.py**
